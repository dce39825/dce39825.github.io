      <h1 class="center blanco underline">A bit of my story.</h1>
      <p class="blanco center">My name is Chandler Eckler and I am from Fitzgerald, Georgia, which is a very small town in South Georgia with a population of around 10,000 people. It is one of those towns where everyone knows everyone and most people never leave. For me, I have always wanted to come to the University of Georgia and move away to live in Athens, and claim it as my second home. I was very community oriented growing up and was heavily involved in a lot of things throughout high school. I did a lot of things to try and figure out what I wanted to do when I got older. My first job was working in the community bank of Fitzgerald. Here I learned a lot about the banking world to see what it had to offer. After working here, I realized that I wanted to do something with business, and maybe one day have my own. My second job was working under my father who is a CPA and runs a partnership. This really opened my eyes and I realized that there were many options of jobs that I could choose to do when I got older.</p>

      <h1 class="center blanco underline">What I want for my future.</h1>
      <p class="blanco center">I am currently a sophomore here at the University of Georgia. I was just accepted into the Terry College of Business and I am pursuing a degree in accounting. I also plan on getting my masters along with my CPA certificate once I complete my undergrad. School has always been an important part of my life because I know I must do good in it to be successful. My career goal as of right now is to be the Chief Financial Officer of Coca Cola. This will take me many years but once I set my mind to something, I do not let anything stop me or get in my way. I am a very self-motivated person and want to succeed in everything that I do. I plan to intern with Coca Cola before I graduate and then begin working there once I graduate and start moving my way up the ladder. Another option that I am not throwing out, is returning home and taking over my dadâ€™s business. As of right now, I am just opening all the doors I can and taking all the opportunities I can to ensure that I am successful in the future.

  <h1 class="center blanco">More you should know about me.</h1>
  <p class="blanco center">
    Another big part of my life has been the sport of pole vaulting. Along with school, I dedicated my four years of high school to this sport. I began the summer before my freshman year and I practiced and competed year around. Fortunately for me, I had one of the best coaches in the business. He was a two-time world champion in the sport and he lived a couple blocks down from my house. Along with school and pole vaulting, church and volunteering have also been a big factor in my life. I am a member of the First Baptists Church of Fitzgerald and have been a member there all my life. I was heavily involved with the youth program that was there until I moved to college. Here in Athens, I have gone to Watkinsville Baptists Church and AthensChurch. I have also joined clubs like Miracle and Shop with a Bulldawg that have given me opportunities to volunteer.
